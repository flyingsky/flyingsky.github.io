title: Meta Interview 2025
categories: home
---

Most people suggests keeping interview every year to make sure you have the ability to find a better job, especially when you're fired.

This should be the 3rd or 4th times to interview Facebook/Meta. Without surprise, I fail again. But I feel much better because I didn't expect anything in the beginning. I don't think I'm ready to join Meta, especially many people mention the survival rate as L6 in Meta is very low. I just told myself it's another try to learn something.

Here briefly records my interview process and some thoughts. I could not leak the interview questions, but I list all the leetcode problems with Meta tag based on https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1117997-1-1.html.

### First Interview

I was contacted by the Meta recruiter because I was interviewed 2023. I didn't try Meta 2024 even I was contacted too, because I didn't have plan to join Meta. This year is the same, but I want to know my interview skill, so I decided to try.

In the first interview(45min), I met a nice guy, who has soft voice. I was asked 2 easy Leetcode questions. I quickly hacked the first question. I hack the second question too, but not the optimal solution. Fortunately I passed the first interview. So I scheduled the onsite interview in 4 weeks later.

In the last 5mins of the interview, I'm asking one question, what's the point if the leetcode question could not figure out if the candidate is great in the daily job, because Meta keeps laying off low performance employees? He just answered this was still the best way before they figured out a better way.

### Virtual Onsite

Virtual onsite interviews still have 5 sessions, but were scheduled in 2 days. Sessions 1-3 were in the first day, another 2 sessions were in the second day.

#### Session 1: Coding

This interviewer is a nice guy, polite and warm. Try to discuss the problem, not challege the interviewee. I got 2 Leetcode Medium problems.

#### Session 2: System Design

A Chinese interviewer, who is aggresive and challenge interviewee all the time. I didn't like him. I feel I should be failed by this guy. His design question was a bad example when I was trained as interviewer in Uber. For example, design a system like Uber. This kind of design question is meaningless, because Uber has a lot of systems, do you want to design booking, login, tracking, payment, etc. So the design question should be specific.

So I ask some questions, then he mentioned some key requirements to make the scope clear. Of course the interview question is not design Uber, but it's design XXX.

I provided one client heavy solution, but avoid server side complexity, which is not expected by the interviewer, but it works, even works without big problem from scaling thousands users to million users, because it doesn't need to worry about server scaling up. The client logic is not too complex.

It seems the interviewer is not familiar with the client, so it's very surprised for him. But he didn't guide me to the server solution, so he could not ask more deeper questions. But the interview session is finished 10 mins earlier, not 5 mins as other sessions. I felt we both want to finish the unhappy discussion as soon as possible.

#### Session 3: Coding

It is a Chinese interviewer too, but this guy is much nice. It seems we were discussing something. If I didn't provide his expected answers, he would provide some hints to lead me to the right direction he wanted.

The first question is easier, but we discuss some time and space complexity in the recursive solution. Then I changed the recursive to while-loop solution. Actually I know the optimal solution, I should go for it directly, then I will not waste time in the time/space complexity discussion, especially which shows I'm not very familiar with the O(n) calculation. In the end, I provided right answers with his hints.

The second question is a hard question. I didn't finish it, but provide some key points like BFS idea, and implemented the BFS.

#### Session 4: Product Design

The last product design discussion had a broader scope, including metrics definition. This time, the focus is narrowed to system design, specifically looking at the system's architecture and boundaries (breadth of components and connections) rather than implementation depth, no product idea and strategy questions.

This interviewer was nice too.

#### Session 5: Behavior

Another nice interviewer, who is a researcher and should has higher level. Just follow the STAR rules to answer different questions. It's a nice discussion and we can learn from each other. Usually the higher position person, the more humble and nicer.

The better interviewer tries to find your shining part and hope your interview successful.
