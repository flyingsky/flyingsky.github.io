Recent days knows a lot of interview questions, some of them are interesting.

1. We have `n` houses and `m` colors, to paint house `i` with color `j`, we need pay money `prices[i][j]`. Note adjacent houses cannot use same color to paint. Find the cheapest way to paint the `n` houses with `m` colors.

  DP problem. Suppose P[i][j] represents the min payment paint houses from 0 to i and house i with color j. So

  P[i][j] = min{P[i-1][k]} + prices[i][j],  k=0 to m-1 and k != j

  The final result is min{P[n-1][j]} where j=[0, m-1].

2. We have `n` houses in a circle and each house has cash `cash[i]`. Suppose theft grab the cash from these houses, he cannot grab the money from adjacent houses. For example, we have 5 houses, possible way is grab house [0, 2], but [0, 2, 4] is not possible, because houses 0 and 4 are adjacent in circle. (DP question)

3. Binary tree, add next pointer to each node which points to the adjacent right node. For example:


                          a
                    b           c
                 d     e     #     f  

\# means empty node. So we have to make b.next points to c, d.next points to e, e.next points to f.

Solution: BFS can solve it. Also we can use recursive without extra space.

4. Reverse linked list since start position to end position, like function reverse(Node head, int start, int end).

5. Binary Tree rotate 90 degree in clockwise, suppose right node is empty or leaf node.

                      a                              b
                  b       c          =>          c       a


                      a                              f
                  b        c        =>                   d
              d       e                               e      b
          f                                              c       a
