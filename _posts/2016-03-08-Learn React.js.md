title: Learn React.js
---

Finally have chance to learn React.js, because we need choose one from Angular.js 2 and React.js. To learn React.js, I find some good articles to start.

1. [React.js website](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
2. If you don't understand whole stuff, you can see some easy and good articles [Start React.js](https://scotch.io/tag/react)
3. [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#content). You can read one Flux implementation from Facebook [github](https://github.com/facebook/flux). Or even another alternative [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
4. [Async Request with React.js and Flux](http://www.code-experience.com/async-requests-with-react-js-and-flux-revisited/)

After read all of above you can understand what's React and how to use it to build big app based on Flux architecture. I think #4 is very important to figure out how to use ajax to call web service.
