## Getting Started

If you're completely new to Jekyll, I recommend checking out the documentation at <http://jekyllrb.com> or there's a tutorial by [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

### Installing Jekyll

If you don't have Jekyll already installed, you will need to go ahead and do that.

```
$ gem install jekyll
```

### Fork, then clone

Fork the repo, and then clone it so you've got the code locally.

### Modify the _config.yml

The `_config.yml` located in the root of the Pixyll directory contains all of the configuration details
for the Jekyll site. The defaults are:

```yml
# Site settings
title: Pixyll
email: your_email@example.com
author: John Otander
description: "A simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff."
baseurl: ""
url: "http://pixyll.com"

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
permalink: pretty
paginate: 3
```

### Jekyll Serve

Then, start the Jekyll Server. I always like to give the `--watch` option so it updates the generated HTML when I make changes.

```
$ jekyll serve --watch
```

Now you can navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to see the site.

### Using Github Pages

You can host your Jekyll site for free with Github Pages. [Click here](https://pages.github.com/) for more information.

#### A configuration tweak if you're using a gh-pages sub-folder

In addition to your github-username.github.io repo that maps to the root url, you can serve up sites by using a gh-pages branch for other repos so they're available at github-username.github.io/repo-name.

This will require you to modify the `_config.yml` like so:

```yml
# Site settings
title: Repo Name
email: your_email@example.com
author: John Otander
description: "Repo description"
baseurl: "/repo-name"
url: "http://github-username.github.io"

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
permalink: pretty
paginate: 3
```

This will ensure that the the correct relative path is constructed for your assets and posts. Also, in order to run the project locally, you will need to specify the blank string for the baseurl: `$ jekyll serve --baseurl ''`.


### Contact Form

If you'd like to keep the contact form, which uses <http://forms.brace.io/>, you need register an account on it with the email in _config.xml

### Page Animation

If you would like to add a [fade-in-down effect](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/), you can add `animated: true` to your `_config.yml`.

### Google Analytics

If you would like to use google anlytics, register an account on <http://www.google.com/analytics/>, then get your code and replace the google_analytics value in _config.xml.

### Comments

If you would like to use comments for each post, you can register an account on <https://disqus.com/> and get your shortname, then replace the value `disqus_shortname` in _config.xml.
